    <p>A <b>car</b> (or <b>automobile</b>) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of
        <i>cars</i> say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly
        transport people rather than goods.[2][3]
    </p>

    <p>Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is
        regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
        Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the
        1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where
        they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other
        parts of the world

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North
        French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart," both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros
        "chariot."[13][14] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or
        wagon.[15][16]

    <p>The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed—and quite possibly built—by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish
        member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672.It was a 65-centimetre (26 in)-long scale-model toy for the
        Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[10][23][24] It is not known with certainty if
        Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.[24]
